Thrift Code Compiler
====================

This compiler takes thrift files as input and generates output code across
various programming languages. To build and install it, do this:

  ./bootstrap.sh
  ./configure
  make
  sudo make install

It requires some form of LEX and YACC to be installed, which should be
picked up by autoconf.

Not much else to report here. You'll have to look at the code to get your
questions answered. Or just run the executable after you build and take
a look at the usage message.
