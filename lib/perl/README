Using Thrift with Perl
=====================

Thrift requires Perl >= 5.6.0

Exceptions are thrown with die so be sure to wrap eval{} statments
around any code that contains exceptions.

The 64bit Integers work only upto 2^42 on my machine :-?
Math::BigInt is probably needed.

The only other issue I have with this implementation is the lack of
strict accessor methods, for example: to set a struct with variable
foo you must assign it via hash key:

my $x = new StructWithFoo();
$x->{foo} = "bar";

rather than:

$x->foo("bar");

Please see tutoral and test dirs for examples...

Dependencies
============

Bit::Vector - comes with modern perl installations.
