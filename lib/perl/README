Using Thrift with Perl
=====================

Thrift requires Perl >= 5.6.0

Exceptions are thrown with die so be sure to wrap eval{} statments
around any code that contains exceptions.

The 64bit Integers work only upto 2^42 on my machine :-?
Math::BigInt is probably needed.

Please see tutoral and test dirs for examples...

Dependencies

Bit::Vector     - comes with modern perl installations.
