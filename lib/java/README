Using Thrift with Java
======================

The Thrift Java source is not build using the GNU tools, but rather uses
the Apache Ant build system, which tends to be predominant amongst Java
developers.

To compile the Java Thrift libraries, simply do the following:

ant

Yep, that's easy. Look for libthrift.jar in the base directory.

To include Thrift in your applications simply add libthrift.jar to your
classpath, or install if in your default system classpath of choice.
