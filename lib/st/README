To get started, just file in thrift.st with Squeak, and run something like:

sock := TSocket new host: 'localhost'; port: 9090; open.
prot := TBinaryProtocol new transport: sock.
calc := CalculatorClient new inProtocol: prot.
calc addNum1: 10 num2: 15

Tested in Squeak 3.7, but should work fine with anything later.
